My research is about conveying touch sensation without any contact! Specifically, I am using array of ultrasound speakers to induce touch at a distance. From acoustic, to psychophysics and from skin mechanics to human computer interaction, I am curious about all the aspects of mid-air haptics and what makes it possible.<br><br>Mixing industrial R&D and academic research, I have the chance to work on cutting-edge apparatus and state-of-the-art equipment, and to publish in journals and conference. Through this unique position, I want to show that research in Industry can be of quality without being secretive.<br><br>I am currently the recipient of a UKRI funded Future Leaders Fellowship and Ultraleap co-PI for the EU funded PRO-ACT/H2020 Touchless projects. Before that, I was Ultraleap co-PI for the project FET-OPEN/H2020 H-Reality and key-person for the project Innovation Launchpad ETexturess, both fundeed by the EU.</p></div><div class="container-sm mt-3 pt-5" id="Interests"><h2>Research Interest</h2><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-4 pt-3"><h3 class="card-title">Touching Ultrasound</h3><p class="card-text" style="width:90%">Have you ever been to a concert and feel the bass in your chest? What you felt is called Acoustic Radiation Pressure. And while it will shake your whole body when it's audible sound, it only vibrates a small point on your skin when it's ultrasound. Mid-air haptics, via ultrasound phased array, can control this phenomenon to produce touch. By applying Acoustic Radiation Pressure to your palm (thank you hand tracking), we can deflect your skin and render any sort of tactile effects. But what is the relationship between ultrasound phased array output, skin displacement and touch perception? Can we do better touch sensation?</p></div><div class="col-lg-4 pt-3"><h3 class="card-title">Designing Touch</h3><p class="card-text" style="width:90%">Our sense of touch is not sensitive to ultrasonic frequencies, so how can mid-air haptics convey different tactile effects? The answer is modulation techniques. Amplitude Modulation and Spatiotemporal Modulation are the most common ones but there are more. So with so many techniques and associated parameters, how to design touch with mid-air haptics? What is the relationship between modulation parameters and perception? Can we convey shapes, textures, buttons or even emotions?</p></div><div class="col-lg-4 pt-3"><h3 class="card-title">Human Computer Interaction</h3><p class="card-text" style="width:90%">Mid-air haptics enable spatial interactions with tactile feedback directly on your hands, without wearables or controlers. One can finally reach out and touch the digital world! Now, that we open a new realm of possibilities, what are the best practice? What are the opportunities and advantages? When, where and how is it best to provide virtual touch, whilst keeping the interaction natural?</p></div></div></div><div class="container-sm mt-3 pt-5" id="Publications"><h2>Publications</h2><h3>Article in Journals</h3><h3>Article in Proceedings</h3><h3>Short Article in Proceedings</h3><h3>Demonstrations</h3><h3>Book and Chapters in books</h3><h3>Patents</h3></div><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-ka7Sk0Gln4gmtz2MlQnikT1wXgYsOg+OMhuP+IlRH9sENBO0LRn5q+8nbTov4+1p" crossorigin="anonymous"></script></body></html>
